/**
 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 *
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node
 * to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
 * The path does not need to go through the root.
 *
 Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:
 Q: What if the tree is empty?
 A: Assume the tree is non-empty.
 Q: How about a tree that contains only a single node?
 A: Then the maximum path sum starts and ends at the same node.
 Q: What if every node contains negative value?
 A: Then you should return the single node value that is the least negative.
 Q: Does the maximum path have to go through the root node?
 A: Not necessarily. For example, the below tree yield 6
 as the maximum path sum and does not go through root.

    Anytime when you found that doing top down approach uses a lot of repeated calculation,
    bottom up approach usually is able to be more efficient.

    This is bottom up approach. At each node, the potential max path could be:
    i.  max(left subtree) + node
    ii. max(right subtree) + node
    iii. max(left subtree) + max(right subtree) + node
    iv. the node itself
