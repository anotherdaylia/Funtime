/**
 * Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.
 * Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
 *
 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and
 * O(nodes) time complexity.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
 * return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
 *
 * Note:
 * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
